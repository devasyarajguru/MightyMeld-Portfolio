# üöÄ MightyMeld-Portfolio (Freelance Project)

‚≠ê MightyMeld is a revolutionary dev tool designed to accelerate your React development. With visual and intuitive superpowers, you can:

- Fly through UI updates as you code
- Drag, drop, click, and prompt your UI into place
- Generate code that looks like you wrote it

Start with "Open in Editor" to see a live visualization of your code paired with the DOM of your running app. Code this way once, and there's no going back. Nudge styles, drag elements around, and experiment visually‚Äîyour code updates seamlessly.

‚úÖ I have used this tool to build a static portfolio website to demonstrate the capabilities of MightyMeld and to record the video of the development process.
